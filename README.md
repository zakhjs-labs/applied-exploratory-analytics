# Applied Exploratory Analytics

This repository contains applied analytics work using Python, with a focus on:

-   ðŸ§ª A/B testing platform design and experiments
-   ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-   ðŸ§¬ Simulation-based inference and statistical validation

## Folder structure

-   [`data/`](./data) â€” Raw data used in notebooks (e.g., CSVs)
-   [`ab_testing/`](./ab_testing) â€” A/B testing platform, experiment design, and statistical techniques

coming soon..

-   `eda/` â€” Exploratory analysis of datasets not tied to A/B testing
-   `experiments/` â€” Simulation-based studies and power/fwer evaluations
-   `utils/` â€” Common utility functions

Each folder contains individual Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts dedicated to specific studies or components.
