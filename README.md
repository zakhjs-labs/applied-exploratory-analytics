-   ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-   ðŸ§¬ Simulation-based inference and statistical validation

## Folder structure

-   `data/` â€” Raw data used in notebooks (e.g., CSVs)
-   `ab_testing/` â€” A/B platform components and statistical evaluations

coming soon..

-   `eda/` â€” Exploratory analysis of datasets not tied to A/B testing
-   `experiments/` â€” Simulation-based studies and power/fwer evaluations
-   `utils/` â€” Common utility functions

Each folder contains individual Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts dedicated to specific studies or components.
